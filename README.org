#+TITLE: convert-coordinates

The active repository is at https://codeberg.org/glv/convert-coordinates

This is a Common Lisp program that can convert the coordinates of two locations
between the following systems:
 - Latitude/Longitude
 - Universal Transverse Mercator / Universal Polar Stereographic
 - Military Grid Reference System
 - Maidenhead
 - Open Location Code

It also shows the locations as well as the orthodrome and loxodrome between
these locations on a world map.

There is also a command line version of the program, which doesn't have a map.

* Running the program
The program requires the following dependencies:
 - [[https://codeberg.org/glv/maidenhead][maidenhead]]
 - [[https://codeberg.org/McCLIM/McCLIM][mcclim]]
 - [[https://codeberg.org/glv/mgrs][mgrs]]
 - [[https://codeberg.org/glv/olc][olc]]
 - [[https://codeberg.org/glv/utm-ups][utm-ups]]

Once the program and its dependencies are in paths where ASDF can see them,
you can run it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(asdf:load-system "convert-coordinates")
(convert-coordinates:gui)
#+END_SRC

You can run the command line version with:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(asdf:load-system "convert-coordinates-cli")
(convert-coordinates-cli:cli)
#+END_SRC

* Building a standalone executable
A Makefile is available to build standalone executables for the programs using
[[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]].

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make
./convert-coordinates
./convert-coordinates-cli
#+END_SRC
